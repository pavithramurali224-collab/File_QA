This documentation explains the full workflow for building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain, FAISS vector store, HuggingFace embeddings, and a FLAN-T5 model. The script allows uploading documents (PDF, DOCX, or TXT), converting them into chunks, embedding them, storing them in FAISS.
